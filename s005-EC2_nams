1.	Launching Ec2 Instance
Has User data : -. Batch script

Run the instance in the web browser
	Execute the instance using the Public IPV4
	Incase if we stop and start the Instance the new Public IPV4 will be created and the private IPV4 will remain same
    
    ----------------------------
2.	Ec2 Instance Types:
    Compute Optimized:  For high performance task
    UseCase:
            Batch processing workloads, Media Transcoding, High Performance Webservers, High Performance Computing, 	Scientific Modeling and ML, Dedicated gaming servers.
            
    Memory Optimized: For large dataset in memory
    UseCase:
        High Performance for Relational/non Relational DB, Distributed webscale cache stores, In-memory DB for BI, Appln performing real-time processing big unstructured data
    Storage Optimized:  Storage Intensive-task require high sequential read &write access to large set of data in local storage
    UseCase:
        High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) system
        Relational & Nosql DB
        Cache for inmemory DB
        Data warehousing appln
        Distributed File System
    Ec2 Examples:
        T2.micro, t2.xlarge, c5d.4xlarge, r5.16xlarge, m5.8xlarge
      -------------------------
      
    Security Groups:
        Fundamental NW security, They control how NW traffic allowed IN or OUT of our EC2 instances. Security grp only contains allow rules
        Rules can reference by IP (IPV4 / IPV6) or by Security grp
        Firewall on EC2 instance, controls inbound and outbound traffic
        Good to main one security grp for SSH access
        Default: All inbound traffic is blocked, outbound traffic is allowed
      ------------------------------
        
Classic Ports to know
        22 – SSH, SFTP
        21-FTP
        80-HTTP, 443 – HTTPS, 
        3389 – RDP(Remotte Desk Protocol) – Log into windows instances
        Hands On: done
        SSH Summary:
            SSH for Linux, Mac, Win >=10
            Putty: Wind >=10 and Wind<=10
            AWS Instance Connect; All (Linux, Mac and Win)
        Used Instance Connect to connect to Ec2 Instance . Yet to try SSH from Lnux
        
        ---------------------------------
        
IAM Roles Demo:
        Attach IAM roles to the EC2 instances .
        While connecting to the Ec2 Instance via SSH/ Instance connect. 
        Execute: aws iam list-users
        
        --------------------------------------
        
EC2 Instance Purchase option:
        On-Demand Inst: 
            Short workload, predictable pricing, pay by scale, Cannot be interruoted, 
            Linx & Wind: billing after per sec, after the first minute
            All other OS: Billing per hour, Cost- Highest, No upfront payment
        Reserved (1 & 3 years):
            EC2 reserved Instances:
            72% discount, Buy & Sell Reserved Instance
            Reserved Instances (long workloads, wo Interruption)
            Convertible Reserved Instances: Long workload with Flexible
            Upto 66% discount

        Savings Plan (1 & 3 yrs) Long workload, Locked to specific instance family  & AWS Region
        Spot Instances: Short workloads, cheap and can be interrupted
            Upto 90% discount. Most cost effective , not suitable for critical jobs
            If you want to close the spot instance it has to be Open, Active or disabled state
        Spot fleet:
            Spot instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
            Stops Launching instances when it reached Max limit
            Automatically request Spot instances with low price
        Dedicated Hosts: 
        Book Entire Server, Control instance placement, Most expensive option , Useful for software that have complicatd licensing model

        Dedicated Instances – 
        No other customers will share ur HW, no control over instance placement (eg: Booking the entire buikding of ur resort)
        Capacity Reservation:
            Reserve Capacity in a specific AZ for any duration (Eg: Book a room for a period for the full price even u don’t stay in it)
            Went thru handson EC2 Instance types
